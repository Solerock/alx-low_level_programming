Task 0: For this task, I will create the static library libmy.a
The command can be found in the  file: libmy.a & main.h

Task 1: For this task, I will create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
The command can be found in the  file create_static_lib.sh
